# Rat-Head-Direction

Quantifies rat-object interaction frames. Note: only works for current implant design (7/5/2020). Can easily be modified to work with other implant designs however. Requires labeled videos (see DLC_network notebook on using DLC to train a neural net to track various rat features).
